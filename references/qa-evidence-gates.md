# QA evidence gates (before completion claims)

Adapted from evidence-before-claims discipline for **QA deliverables**. Use with [verify-closing-checklist.md](verify-closing-checklist.md).

## Gate function

Before claiming **passed**, **posted**, **created**, **retest complete**, or **tests done**:

1. **IDENTIFY** — What check proves this? (command, URL re-read, file exists)  
2. **RUN** — Execute it fresh in this session (not an earlier turn)  
3. **READ** — Full output or visible UI state  
4. **MATCH** — Does evidence support the exact claim?  
5. **CLAIM** — State result **with** evidence snippet or path  

Skip a step → treat as unverified.

## Claim → evidence map

| Claim | Requires | Not sufficient |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| Playwright / tests passed | Test runner exit 0 + summary shows 0 failed for in-scope tests | “Should pass”, prior run, agent said success |
| Playwright failed | Failing test name + log/trace path or screenshot | Vague “broken” |
| Jira comment posted | GET issue or open UI — comment body visible, row count matches draft, **no literal `<br>`/HTML tags**, numbered items on separate lines, CSV attached | POST API 201 only, MCP “success”, unchecked comment |
| Jira transition done | Issue status in UI/API matches target transition | Transition API called once |
| CSV/Excel exported | File exists in workspace + row count = approved table | Wrote path without opening file |
| Retest PASSED | Evidence in comment matches checks in [retest-fix-intake.md](retest-fix-intake.md) plan | Dev said fixed |
| Retest FAILED | Failing check documented with evidence | Assumed still broken |
| Bug created | Issue URL returns title + body matching approved draft | Create API returned id only |
| Coverage review complete | Posted review block with **Ready for draft: YES** + coverage delta | “Looks complete” |
| Environment reachable | URL load or curl returns expected status (not CF block) | VPN “should” work |

## Wording red flags

Do not use without fresh evidence in the **same** turn:

- should, probably, seems, likely, I believe  
- Done!, Perfect!, Great!, Successfully! (before gate 5)  
- Posted (without URL re-read)  
- All tests pass (without runner output)

## Workflow pointers

| Workflow | Extra gate |
|----------|------------|
| TC FE / API | Coverage review YES + delta before full draft |
| Testing ticket | [playwright-preflight.md](playwright-preflight.md) YES before run; F1–F3 before external update |
| Retest | Plan posted before execute; v2/v3 format locked |
| Create bug | Phase C confirm before create; URL verify after |
