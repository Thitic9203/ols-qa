  Prepare frontend manual test cases from a Jira story (AC/EC) with mandatory AC/EC coverage review and ISTQB/29119-3 quality check, then draft table in chat, export CSV/Excel, and publish one comment on that story only.
  Use when the user asks for FE test cases, manual TC from acceptance criteria, draft TC comment on Jira, or TC FE Preparation from Helix (/tc-fe-prep).
  Do NOT use for API-only Swagger test cases (tc-api-prep-workflow), Playwright execution (testing-ticket-workflow), retest-after-fix (retest-bug-workflow), or opening bug tickets (create-bug-workflow).

# TC FE Prep Workflow

Prepare **frontend manual test cases** from a Jira **story** (acceptance criteria + edge cases), get user approval in chat, then publish **one comment** on **that story only** with a markdown table plus a downloadable CSV/Excel attachment.

**Portable:** Works in any AI agent that can read this skill. **Project-agnostic:** No hardcoded repos, paths, or ticket numbers.

## Discipline

Follow [shared-preamble.md](../../references/shared-preamble.md). Ask one focused question at a time when setup is missing.

## Refusal-first (precondition gate)

MUST refuse to start until the user provides a **Jira story key or browse URL** — because TC rows must trace to AC/EC on a specific issue.

If missing, stop with the refusal template from skill-rules-style.md (list missing items; do not invent a story).

## Prerequisites (read before Step 0)

Read [references/prerequisites.md](references/prerequisites.md) and [references/jira-formatting.md](references/jira-formatting.md).

**Before Step 0:** confirm the **story** issue key with the user; NEVER post to Jira until they approve the draft in chat — because premature comments are hard to retract cleanly.

On first response after constraints, follow [workspace-guide-discovery.md](../../references/workspace-guide-discovery.md) for **TC FE prep**.

---

## Step 0 — Obtain the story

If the user did not provide a ticket key or URL:

> Which Jira story should I prepare FE test cases for? Please share the issue key or browse URL.

**Wait for an answer.** Extract `{ISSUE_KEY}` and `{JIRA_DOMAIN}` from the URL when possible.

---

## Step 1 — Load or create project config

If workspace-guide-discovery already loaded a guide → use it and go to Step 2.

Otherwise:

1. Ask using `references/project-config-template.md` (one section at a time).
2. Offer to save answers into `references/{PROJECT}-tc-fe-prep-guide.md` in the user’s repo.

Config should capture: Jira domain, default story vs sub-task policy, portal names, shared login role, CSV column headers (if non-default), export format preference (`csv` / `xlsx`; default `csv`), and publish method preference.

---

## Step 2 — Extract requirements

From the Jira story, build a checklist:

| Source | Extract |
|--------|---------|
| AC rows | Actor, action, expected UI/API outcome |
| EC rows | Invalid input, validation messages, blocked save |
| Description | Status names, tabs, field limits, forbidden actions |
| Linked docs | Seed data steps (reference by ticket id in text only) |

**Must not:** Copy unrelated business rules from other stories unless user confirms they apply to an AC/EC here.

---

## Step 3 — Design test cases

Default **9 columns** (change only if user specifies otherwise):

| Column | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Acceptance Criteria | AC_0n / EC_0n label + short summary |
| Services Impacted | e.g. `- Service Name` |
| Test Case ID | Stable id e.g. `TC_Feature_01` |
| Test Title | Action + expected outcome (no `[Tag]` prefixes unless user wants them) |
| Precondition | Shared prep done + per-case setup |
| Test Data | Values to enter |
| Test Steps | Numbered manual steps |
| Expected Result | Numbered assertions |
| Priority | High / Medium / Low |

**Shared data prep (above table)** — typical pattern:

1. Log in with the required role.
2. Navigate to the feature area.
3. Open the correct tab or filter.
4. Ensure required data state exists (with "if missing, create via …" referencing another story id if needed).
5. Identify the target entity used across TCs.

Add a **Precondition column note** above the table explaining that the column means: *after shared prep, before Test Steps*.

---

## Step 4 — Coverage & quality review (mandatory; 1–2 rounds)

MUST complete **before** Step 5. Do not skip because the first draft “looks fine.”

### 4a — AC / EC coverage (FE scope)

Follow [ac-ec-coverage-review.md](references/ac-ec-coverage-review.md):

- Build the **traceability matrix** (every AC and EC → one or more `TC_*`).
- Confirm **ไม่ขาด** (full AC/EC outcomes covered), **ไม่เกิน / ไม่กาว / ไม่เพ้อ** (no orphan or invented cases).
- Row count **need not** equal AC+EC count; alignment matters, not 1:1 rows.

### 4b — International TC quality (ISTQB + ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-3)

Follow [tc-quality-standards.md](../../references/tc-quality-standards.md) on every row (objective, preconditions, steps, expected results, priority, observability).

### 4c — Post review summary in chat

Post the **FE TC coverage review** block from ac-ec-coverage-review.md (with **Ready for draft: YES**).

MUST NOT show the full TC table until **Ready for draft: YES** — because stakeholders approve coverage before row-level editing.

### 4d — Coverage delta summary

Post the table from [coverage-delta-template.md](../../references/coverage-delta-template.md) (FE section) — even when all rows are `OK`.

If review fails → fix Step 3 design and re-run 4a–4d (max 2 rounds).

---

## Step 5 — Draft in chat (approval gate)

Post the full draft in the conversation:

```text
Draft TC FE as below

**Shared data preparation (all TCs):**
1. ...
2. ...

**Note — Precondition column:** After completing shared prep above, complete the numbered items in Precondition before Test Steps.

| **Acceptance Criteria** | **Services Impacted** | **Test Case ID** | **Test Title** | **Precondition** | **Test Data** | **Test Steps** | **Expected Result** | **Priority** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ... one row per TC ... |
```

**Header rule:** Every column header MUST be wrapped in `**bold**` in the chat draft, the Jira comment, and the markdown `.md` file — e.g. `| **Acceptance Criteria** |`. This applies here and in Step 7.

State clearly: **Not posted to Jira yet.**

**Wait for approval** or edit requests. Apply feedback, then re-show the changed sections.

---

## Step 6 — Save artifacts in the user's workspace

After approval, determine the export format first (see [csv-export-rules.md](../../references/csv-export-rules.md) — Format detection section), then write files **inside the user's project** (paths relative to workspace root):

| File | Condition | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `references/{ISSUE_KEY}_FE_TC.md` | always | Canonical markdown (prep block + table) |
| `references/{ISSUE_KEY}_FE_TC.csv` | default (no Excel request) | UTF-8 BOM CSV export |
| `references/{ISSUE_KEY}_FE_TC.xlsx` | user explicitly requested Excel/xlsx | Excel workbook export |

Follow [csv-export-rules.md](../../references/csv-export-rules.md) for the full export procedure — CSV (in-agent default) or xlsx (Python + openpyxl when user requests Excel). Never silently produce a CSV when the user asked for xlsx.

See [references/publish-options.md](references/publish-options.md) for Jira delivery.

---

## Step 7 — Publish to Jira (story only)

**Target:** `{ISSUE_KEY}` story the user specified.

**Pre-post conversion (mandatory):** Before building the comment body, convert every `<br>` in table cells to Jira-native line breaks. Full rules: [jira-linebreak-conversion.md](../../references/jira-linebreak-conversion.md). **Never copy the chat draft directly — it contains `<br>` that Jira renders as literal text.**

**Content:** Single comment (unless user asked otherwise) containing:

1. Intro line: `Draft TC FE as below`
2. Shared prep + precondition note
3. Full table (bold header cells) — **with `<br>` already converted**
4. Footer: short note that the CSV/Excel file matches the table + **clickable attachment link** on the same issue

**Publish methods** (choose what works in the environment — details in `references/publish-options.md`):

| Method | When to use |
|--------|-------------|
| Atlassian MCP / REST | Short comments; **verify** full table rendered |
| ADF JSON + browser session | Large tables; upload CSV/xlsx via authenticated session |
| User pastes | Fallback if automation unavailable |

**After publish — mandatory post-publish review on Jira UI:**

Run the **full review checklist** from [jira-comment-post-review.md](../../references/jira-comment-post-review.md). Key checks:

- [ ] All TC rows visible (not header only) — count must match approved draft.
- [ ] **No literal `<br>`, HTML tags, or `**` markers** visible as text in any cell (zero tolerance).
- [ ] Numbered items (`1. ` `2. ` `3. `) each on a **separate line** — not running together.
- [ ] Cell content matches approved draft (spot-check first, middle, last rows).
- [ ] CSV/Excel **attached to the same issue** (not just in workspace) and footer link works.
- [ ] Comment is on the **story**, not a sub-task.

If any check fails → fix and re-post → re-verify on Jira UI (max 3 rounds).

**MUST NOT tell user "commented" or "done" until all checks pass.** See [jira-comment-post-review.md](../../references/jira-comment-post-review.md) for fix procedures and reporting templates.

---

## QA closing (mandatory before "done")

Follow [qa-closing-shared.md](../../references/qa-closing-shared.md) + skill-specific:

- [ ] Step 4 review block posted with **Ready for draft: YES** and traceability matrix complete.
- [ ] AC/EC coverage complete; quality checklist PASS per tc-quality-standards.
- [ ] Export file row count matches table rows (CSV or xlsx per user's requested format).
- [ ] Jira UI matches approved draft (not MCP output alone).
- [ ] Post-publish review passed per [jira-comment-post-review.md](../../references/jira-comment-post-review.md) — no stray tags, numbered items on separate lines, attachment present.
- [ ] Close-out includes `Verified:` after Jira re-open.
- [ ] Publish fix-verify (Step 7) completed — at least one Jira UI re-read.
- [ ] **Fresh-eyes:** re-read full draft before publish when table **> 15 rows**.
- [ ] [verify-closing-checklist.md](../../references/verify-closing-checklist.md) (TC FE section).

---

## Step 8 — Session closing

Follow [session-closing.md](../../references/session-closing.md) — artifact index, one-line next workflow (e.g. `/testing-ticket` on same story), handoff file if long session, `Verdict:` block.

Complete [verify-closing-checklist.md](../../references/verify-closing-checklist.md) (TC FE section).

## Out of scope

- API TC prep, Playwright ticket test, retest, create bug — see [skill-routing.md](../../references/skill-routing.md)

---

## MUST / NEVER

Shared rules: [shared-must-never.md](../../references/shared-must-never.md). Skill-specific:

| Rule | Because |
|------|---------|
| MUST refuse without story key/URL | No traceable AC/EC source |
| MUST NOT comment on sub-tasks or other issues | Scope is one story |
| MUST NOT add TC outside story AC/EC | Traceability |
| MUST NOT reference agent-machine absolute paths in Jira | Other users cannot reproduce |
| MUST run Step 4 review before draft table | Prevents out-of-scope cases reaching Jira |
| MUST apply tc-quality-standards on every row | ISTQB / 29119-3 consistency |
| MUST convert `<br>` to Jira-native line breaks before posting (see [jira-linebreak-conversion.md](../../references/jira-linebreak-conversion.md)) | `<br>` renders as literal text on Jira |
| MUST pass post-publish review ([jira-comment-post-review.md](../../references/jira-comment-post-review.md)) before reporting "commented" or "done" to user | Prevents false success claims with broken formatting |
| MUST attach CSV/Excel to Jira issue when file was generated (not just workspace) | User expects downloadable file on the issue |
| MUST NOT use `\n` inside **chat draft** markdown table cells | Breaks table row in markdown renderers |
